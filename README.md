# Movie Recommendation System

A demonstration project focused on building, evaluating, and understanding recommendation systems for movies.  
This repository provides a variety of techniques, sample code, and clear explanations to help users learn about the development and deployment of movie recommender systems.

## üåü Features

- **Multiple Recommendation Approaches:**  
  Includes both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models.
- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**  
  Detailed EDA (exploratory data analysis) and data cleaning steps.
- **Model Comparison:**  
  Evaluate and compare the performance of different recommender algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:**  
  Well-documented, interactive notebooks for hands-on experimentation and learning.
- **Customizable:**  
  Modular code to easily swap datasets or incorporate new features and algorithms.
- **Sample Data:**  
  Uses open movie datasets (e.g., MovieLens, TMDB) or similar for demonstration.

## üß† Why Recommendation Systems?

Recommendation systems are critical for modern digital platforms to personalize content, improve user engagement, and boost retention.  
This project helps you understand:
- The difference between collaborative and content-based recommendations
- How to handle user and item cold-start problems
- Metrics for evaluating recommender systems
- How to deploy a basic recommender pipeline
